This exercise was part of the Odin Project. The first assignment was to build a Rock Paper Scissors Game you would play on the console. It was pure JavaScript.

The next assignment was to build a UI for the game, so that you have an actual page where you can play. This includes creating buttons for the three options (rock, paper, scissors), making a score board and so on. This part combines JS, HTML and CSS. It's necessary to manipulate the DOM to make the website interactive.

• I have learned a lot about handling (arrow) functions and am also a lot more comfortable using different DOM methods.  
• I learned about adding and removing event listeners.   
• I know how to use classes to add/remove temporary elements/effects.  

This exercise was excellent to get better at combining your JS, HTML and CSS skills!
